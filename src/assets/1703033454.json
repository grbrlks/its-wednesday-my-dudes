{"text": "Picture a vivid scene with a rather quirky character - a bright green frog sporting a pair of swimming goggles. This amphibian isn't just sitting on a lily pad, no. He's engaged in a decidedly human-like situation. Imagine this frog seated at a round wooden table. The table is cluttered with stacks of papers, a half-full cup of coffee, and a desk lamp spilling yellow light across the scene. The frog, looking a bit out of place yet oddly serious, taps a pen against the table as though deep in thought. It's as if he's taken on the role of a diligent office worker, his goggles poised as if ready for an unexpected swim at any moment."}

{"text": "A vivid green tree frog, wearing a pair of crystal clear swimming goggles, set in an oddly human-like situation. The frog finds itself at a desk, amidst a sea of papers and coffee mugs, as if it's in the middle of a busy work day. The frog glances at the clock, as though it's waiting for the day to end, and towards a family photo pinned to the corkboard, creating a scene rich with detail and strangeness."}

{"text": "Visualize a green frog equipped with swimming goggles. The amphibian is in an unusual setting for its species â€“ it is engaged in a human-like activity. Specifically, it is sitting down at a small desk working on a laptop computer, a scene typically experienced in an office environment. Its webbed feet navigate the keyboard while the frog peers attentively at the screen through its goggles. Surrounding the desk are typical office items like a desk lamp, a stack of papers, a mug of coffee and a couple of potted plants that lend a touch of nature to the otherwise mechanical surroundings."}

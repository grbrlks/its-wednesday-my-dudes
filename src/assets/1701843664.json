{"text": "Imagine a medium-sized amphibian, with a smooth, moist skin with shades of green or olive. This frog is notably dressed in a costume usually associated with a well-loved character recognized by a red and blue outfit with a web design, except we can't directly mention that character due to copyright restrictions. In addition, the frog is wearing swimming goggles over its eyes, which create a noticeable amplification of its already large, bulging eyes. The goggles have a clear lens, with an adjustable black strap running across the back of its head. This humorous image juxtaposes the natural world and pop culture."}

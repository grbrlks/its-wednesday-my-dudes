# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! It's people like you that make this project such fun.

## Where do I start?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [issues](https://github.com/grbrlks/its-wednesday-my-dudes/issues) if there's already a ticket for it. If there isn't, feel free to submit a new issue.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b feat/325-add-something
```

## Make the change

Work on the code to fix the issue or implement the new feature.

## Submit a pull request

Push your branch to your fork on GitHub, then submit a pull request. We'll review your changes and give feedback. Once everything is approved, we'll merge your changes into the main branch.

Again, thank you for your contributions!
